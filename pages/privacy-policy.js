          <h2>The Information We Collect</h2>
          <ol className="PrivacyPolicy__list">
            <li>
              In the course of business it is necessary for us to collect Personal Information. This information allows us to identify who an individual is for the purposes of our business, share Personal Information when asked of us, contact the individual in the ordinary course of business and transact with the individual.  Without limitation, the type of information we may collect is:
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Personal Information.</strong>  We may collect personal details such as an individual’s name, location, date of birth, nationality, family details and other information defined as “Personal Information” in the Privacy Act that allows us to identify who the individual is;</li>
                <li><strong>Contact Information.</strong>  We may collect information such as an individual’s email address, telephone &amp; fax number, third-party usernames, residential, business and postal address and other information that allows us to contact the individual;</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Information.</strong>  We may collect financial information related to an individual such as any bank or credit card details used to transact with us and other information that allows us to transact with the individual and/or provide them with our services;</li>
                <li><strong>Statistical Information.</strong>  We may collect information about an individual’s online and offline preferences, habits, movements, trends, decisions, associations, memberships, finances, purchases and other information for statistical purposes; and</li>
                <li><strong>Information an individual sends us.</strong>  We may collect any personal correspondence that an individual sends us, or that is sent to us by others about the individual’s activities.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>We may collect other Personal Information about an individual, which we will maintain in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>
            <li>We may also collect non-Personal Information about an individual such as information regarding their computer, network and browser.  This may include their IP address. Where non-Personal Information is collected the Australian Privacy Principles do not apply.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="4-how-info-is-collected">
          <h2>How Information Is Collected</h2>
          <ol className="PrivacyPolicy__list">
            <li>
              Most information will be collected in association with an individual’s use of Buildkite, an enquiry about Buildkite or generally dealing with us.  However we may also receive Personal Information from sources such as advertising, an individual’s own promotions, public records, mailing lists, contractors, staff, recruitment agencies and our business partners.  In particular, information is likely to be collected as follows:
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Registrations/Subscriptions.</strong> When an individual registers or subscribes for a service, list, account, connection or other process whereby they enter Personal Information details in order to receive or access something, including a transaction;</li>
                <li><strong>Accounts/Memberships.</strong> When an individual submits their details to open an account and/or become a member with us;</li>
                <li><strong>Supply.</strong> When an individual supplies us with goods or services;</li>
                <li><strong>Contact.</strong> When an individual contacts us in any way;</li>
                <li><strong>Access.</strong> When an individual accesses us physically we may require them to provide us with details for us to permit them such access.  When an individual accesses us through the internet we may collect information using cookies (if relevant – an individual can adjust their browser’s setting to accept or reject cookies) or analytical services; and/or</li>
                <li><strong>Pixel Tags.</strong> Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read and they tell us whether mail has been opened.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>As there are many circumstances in which we may collect information both electronically and physically, we will endeavour to ensure that an individual is always aware of when their Personal Information is being collected.</li>
            <li>Where we obtain Personal Information without an individual’s knowledge (such as by accidental acquisition from a client) we will either delete/destroy the information, or inform the individual that we hold such information, in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="5-when-info-is-disclosed">
          <h2>When Personal Information Is Used &amp; Disclosed</h2>
          <ol className="PrivacyPolicy__list">
            <li>In general, the primary principle is that we will not use any Personal Information other than for the purpose for which it was collected other than with the individual’s permission.  The purpose of collection is determined by the circumstances in which the information was collected and/or submitted.</li>
            <li>We will retain Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</li>
            <li>If it is necessary for us to disclose an individual’s Personal Information to third parties in a manner compliant with the Australian Privacy Principles in the course of our business, we will inform you that we intend to do so, or have done so, as soon as practical.</li>
            <li>We will not disclose or sell an individual’s Personal Information to unrelated third parties under any circumstances.</li>
            <li>
              Information is used to enable us to operate our business, especially as it relates to an individual.  This may include:
              <ol>
                <li>The provision of goods and services between an individual and us;</li>
                <li>Verifying an individual’s identity;</li>
                <li>Communicating with an individual about:</li>
                <li>Their relationship with us;</li>

                <li>Our own marketing and promotions to customers and prospects;</li>
                <li>Competitions, surveys and questionnaires;</li>
                <li>Investigating any complaints about or made by an individual, or if we have reason to suspect that an individual is in breach of any of our terms and conditions or that an individual is or has been otherwise engaged in any unlawful activity; and/or</li>
                <li>As required or permitted by any law (including the Privacy Act).</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              There are some circumstances in which we must disclose an individual’s information:
              <ol>
                <li>Where we reasonably believe that an individual may be engaged in fraudulent, deceptive or unlawful activity that a governmental authority should be made aware of;</li>
                <li>As required by any law (including the Privacy Act); and/or</li>
                <li>In order to sell our business (in that we may need to transfer Personal Information to a new owner).</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>We will not disclose an individual’s Personal Information to any entity outside of Australia that is in a jurisdiction that does not have a similar regime to the Australian Privacy Principles or an implemented and enforceable privacy policy similar to this Privacy Policy. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that any disclosure to an entity outside of Australia will not be made until that entity has agreed in writing with us to safeguard Personal Information as we do.</li>
            <li>We may utilise third-pay service providers (such as Gmail from Google, Inc., and MailChimp from The Rocket Science Group LLC) to communicate with an individual and to store contact details about an individual. These service providers are located in the United States of America. No Health Information is stored in any third-party services in Australia or elsewhere.</li>
